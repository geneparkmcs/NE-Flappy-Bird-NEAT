# Flappy Bird with NEAT AI

This project is a Python implementation of the Flappy Bird game, enhanced with NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) to train AI birds to play the game. It uses the `pygame` library for the game and `neat-python` for evolving neural networks that control the birds.

## Features
- Flappy Bird game logic and rendering using `pygame`.
- Randomly generated pipes to challenge the birds.
- AI birds controlled by neural networks, evolved using the NEAT algorithm.
- Fitness function based on survival time and ability to avoid pipes.
  
## Installation

To run this project, you will need to have Python installed on your machine, along with the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install pygame neat-python
